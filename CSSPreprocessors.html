    <h2>What Are CSS Preprocessors?</h2>
    
    <p>CSS preprocessors are tools that help you write better CSS. 
        Instead of writing everything manually, they let you use features like variables, 
        functions, and reusable blocks. This makes your styles easier to manage, cleaner, and more powerful. 
        You still end up with regular CSS in the browser, but the way you write it becomes much more flexible.

    <h2>Functions on CSS</h2>
    
    <p>A much-needed disclaimer: You (kinda) can use functions now! 
        I know, it isn’t the most pleasant feeling to finish reading about a new feature just for the author to say
         “And we’ll hopefully see it in a couple of years”. 
         Luckily, right now you can use an (incomplete) version of CSS functions in Chrome Canary behind an experimental flag, 
         although who knows when we’ll get to use them in a production environment.</p>

    <h2>What exactly is a function in CSS?</h2>
    <p>They are used in the same places you would use a custom property, 
        but functions return different things depending on the argument we pass. 
        The syntax for the most basic function is the @function at-rule, 
        followed by the name of the function as a <dashed-ident> + ()</p>
